# Using Imjoy for image processing

## Basic Usage: the ImJoy web app
 * Go to the [ImJoy web app](https://imjoy.io/#/app), click the **+ PLUGINS** button in `Plugins` to install new plugins from the [Plugin Repository](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Plugins).
 * You can then open files or folders with the **+** button, or drag and drop them to the web app.
 * When files are loaded into the workspace, you can click the file to open it if the file is recognized by ImJoy or any plugin. For example, if you installed the plugin "Tif file importer", you will be able to click the .tif file in the file window.
 * Similar to [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij), when clicking on the plugin menu, ImJoy will try to pass the current active window to the plugin, it then will let the plugin decide how to process the data contained in the window.
 * If you installed plugins written in Python, they will be disabled by default. In order to light them up and benifit from the full power of your computer, you need to setup the **Python Plugin Engine** as follows.

## Advanced Usage: the Python Plugin Engine
You can use the **Python Plugin Engine** to unlock the power of your computer or another computer in your local network.

To use it, go to the [ImJoy web app](https://imjoy.io/#/app), and click the ðŸš€ button located on the upper-right corner, you will find instructions on how to set it up. Basically, you will be asked to install the engine and run `python -m imjoy` to start it.

More detailed instructions can be found here: [ImJoy-Python](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Python).

### How does it work?
ImJoy supports Python Plugins which can run much more computationally intensive tasks. In order to run that, it needs to connect to the Python Plugin Engine -- a small python library we developed for ImJoy (source code: https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Python).

Under the hood, the Python Plugin Engine will be connected with the ImJoy web app through websockets, the interaction is done with remote procedure calls (RPC). When a window in the ImJoy workspace is selected, the contained data (e.g. an image) will be transferred to the Python plugin so it can process the data with the `run` function, results will be send back to the ImJoy workspace and displayed as a new window. Natively, ImJoy supports the conversion and transmission of Numpy arrays and Tensorflow tensors, so plugin developers could just use those data types and exchange them between plugins, no matter they are in Python or Javascript.

## Advanced Usage: Going offline
If you have already installed the **Python Plugin Engine**, then you can run ImJoy in offline mode. What you do is to run the engine with `python -m imjoy --serve` . And it will download all the files for offline access, after that, if you run `python -m imjoy` in the **same directory**, you will have your personal ImJoy web app which can be access by [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Also notice that, even though ImJoy can run without internet, depends on the implementation of the plugin, some plugins maybe unusable when you go offline.

# Developing Plugins for ImJoy

<img src="https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy/raw/master/docs/img/imjoy-code-screenshot.png" width="600px"></img>

Click the **+ PLUGINS** button in `Plugins`, then select `Create a New Plugin` with one of the plugin template. A code editor will show up in the workspace, you can write the code, save it, or install the plugin to the plugin menu. You can then test by click your new plugin in the plugin menu.

The ImJoy plugin file format is built up on html format with customized tags (inspired by the `.vue` format), it consists of two mandatory tags `<config>` and `<script>`, and other optional tags including `<docs>`, `<window>` and `<style>`.  For `<style>`, you can also use `src` property and have multiple of it.

Other optional tags includes `<docs>`, `<attachment>` and `<link>`.

Here is an outline of the plugin file:
```
<config lang="json">
   ** A code block in Json format describes the plugin**
</config>

<script lang="javascript">
   ** A code block in Javascrit or Python format**
</script>

<window lang="html">
   ** A code block in HTML format**
   (for plugins in iframe mode)
</window>

<style lang="css">
   ** A code block in CSS format**
   (for plugins in iframe mode)
</style lang="json">

<docs lang="markdown">
   ** A recommanded code block in Markdown format with the documentation of the plugin **
</docs>

<attachment name="XXXXX">
   ** An optional for storing text data, you can use multiple of them **
</attachment>
```
## The `<config>` tag

```json
{
  "name": "Untitled Plugin",
  "mode": "webworker",
  "tags": ["op", "image"],
  "ui": "image processing",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "api_version": "0.1.0",
  "url": "",
  "description": "A plugin for image processing.",
  "icon": "extension",
  "inputs": null,
  "outputs": null,
  "env": null,
  "requirements": null,
  "dependencies": []
}
```
* `name` the name of the plugin, it must be unique to avoid conflicting with other plugins.
* `mode` the mode of the plugin, currently supported modes are `webworker`, `iframe` and `pyworker`.
  * `webworker` is used to run computationally intensive javascript plugins. It does not have an interface, it runs in a new thread and won't hang the main thread during running.
  * `iframe` is used for create new web interface with HTML/CSS and Javascript, it runs in the same thread as the main webpage. If `iframe` mode is selected, then you need to provied HTML code with the `<window>` tag and CSS code with the `style` tag.
  * `pyworker` is used to run plugins written in Python, the user needs to have the **Python Plugin Engine** installed and started before using the plugin. See the **Developing Python Plugins** for more details.
* `tags` defines the tags for the plugin, if the tag is used for several plugins, they will be grouped in the ops menu shown in workflow.
* `ui` is a string used to generate the GUI to the user, you can include the following elements to render an input form:
  * `type: 'choice', options: ['cat', 'dog'], placeholder: 'cat'`
  * `type: 'number', min: 0, max: 10, placeholder:2`
  * `type: 'color'`
  * `type: 'string'`
  * `type: 'save'`
  * `type: 'instructions/comment'`
  * `type: 'variableName'`
  * ...

  You need to define a unique id for each element, for example `"ui": "select an option: {id: 'option1', type: 'choice', options: ['cat', 'dog'], placeholder: 'cat'}"`

* `version` defines the version of the plugin
* `api_version` api version of imjoy which the plugin is written for
* `url` the url used point to current file, used to download the plugin file when a user install it from the plugin store on imjoy.io website.
* `description` a short description about the plugin, describe the main feature or the context of the plugin
* `icon` defines the icon used in the plugin menu. You can find a material icon from https://material.io/tools/icons/ and set its name to `icon`. Or, you can directly copy and paste Emoji, for example from [here](https://getemoji.com/).
* `inputs` defines the inputs with json-schema syntax (http://json-schema.org/) .
For example, you can use `"inputs": {"properties": {"type": {"enum": ["image/png"], "required": true}}, "type": "object"}` to describe the plugin takes an png image as input. You can also use the simplified format which assumes the inputs is an object and use json schema to describe the properties: `"inputs": {"type": {"enum": ["image/png"], "required": true}}`.
* `outputs` defines the outputs with json-schema syntax (http://json-schema.org/).
The format is exactly the same as `inputs`.
* `env` (**for python plugins only**) the virtual environment or docker image command used for creating an enviroment to run the plugins
* `cmd` (**for python plugins only**) the command used to run the plugin, by default, it will run `python`, sometimes it can be something like `python3` or `python27` etc.
* `requirements` (**for python plugins only**) the pip packages which will be installed before running the plugin, package names or github links are both supported.
* `dependencies` names of other imjoy plugins which the current one depend on. They will be installed automatically during installation.


## The `<docs>` tag
Used to contain documentation for the plugin, it need to be written in `Markdown` language. Here is a document about how to write document in `Markdown`: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## The `<window>` tag
Define the HTML code for displaying in the plugin window.

## The `<style>` tag
Define the CSS code for displaying in the plugin window.

## The `<script>` tag

Plugins can be written in Javascript or Python, a minimal plugin needs to implement two functions: `setup()` and `run()`.
In order to differentiate the two different languages, use the `lang` property of the `<script>` tag:
 * for Javascript plugin, use `<script lang="javascript"> ... </script>`
 * for Python plugin, use `<script lang="python"> ... </script>`

Optionally, if you provided a function called `exit`, it will be called when the plugin is being killed.

### `setup()` function
`setup` function used to get the plugin prepared for running, it will be executed when the plugin during initialization.

### `run()` function
`run` function will be called each time a user click on the menu or run a workflow is executed. While executed, an object(for Javascript) or a dictionary(for Python) called `my` will be passed into the function.

### optional: `update()` function
Optionally, you can define an update function which will be called when any setting of the op is changed.

All the plugins can access `config` and `data` from `my`:

 * `my.config`
 The config values from the user interface defined with the `ui` string (from the plugin config or `api.register`).
 * `my.data`
 It stores the data from current active window and state for running the plugin.

 * `my._variables`
     When the plugin is executed in a workflow, variables will be set in the workflow will be passed as `my._variables`. It will be set to the actual variable value if the user used ops such as `Set [number]`.
 * `my._op`
     Give the name of the op which is being executing. When a plugin registered for multiple ops and no callback function was specified for the op, the `run` function will be called, and you can use `my._op` to determine which op is being executing.
 * `my._source_op`
     Give the name of the op which initiated current execution.
 * `my._workflow_id`
     When the plugin is executed in a workflow, the workflow id will be set in the workflow will be passed as `my._workflowId`.

     When the plugin is clicked in the plugin menu, ImJoy will try to reuse the workflow id in the current active window, if no window is active, a new workflow id will be assigned. All the data window with the same `_workflow_id` is virtually connected in a pipeline or computational graph. By combining `_workflow_id` with `_op` and `_source_op`, ImJoy can track, maintain and reconstruct the entire workflow.

  Importantly, `_workflow_id`, `_variables`, `_op` and `_source_op` can be used to implement interactivity between plugins, meaning if the user changed a state in one of the result window, downstream of the workflow will be updated automatically.


For the results, you can directly return your result and it will show in a result window. If you want to define the type of your result, or return multiple results, you can construct a new `my` variable(dictionary or object) with two fields `config` and `data`. Here is an example:
```javascript
   my = {
      "config": {},
      "data": {
         "data_1": {"type": "image/grayscale", "image": img},
         "result_tensor": {"type": "tensor", "tensor": t}
      }
   }
   return my
```
In the result, two fields named `data_1` and `result_tensor` will be displayed in a result window or passed to the next op in a workflow.

Since ImJoy use postMessage to exchange data between plugins, for Javascript plugins, objects are cloned during the transfer. When there is a large object exchange, it will be more effective if the object created by a plugin can be directly transferred. To enable that, you can add `_transfer=true` to your object when you return it. For example, in the above example, you can set `my._transfer = true` when you return `my`. However, it will only speed up the transferring of `ArrayBuffers` or `ArrayBufferViews` (and also ndarrays produced by Python), and after transferring, you won't be able to access it.

(**Note**: in Python, the data type of `my` is a dictionary, ImJoy added the interface for allowing dot notation, just like in Javascript. If you prefer, you can also use `[]` in both languages to access dictionary or object.)

### Javascript example
```html
<script lang="javascript">
class UntitledPlugin {
  async setup() {
    console.log('initialized from Javascript.');
  }

  async run(my) {
    console.log('hello world.');
    return my;
  }
}

api.export(new UntitledPlugin())
</script>
```

### Python example
```html
<script lang="python">
class UntitledPythonPlugin():
  def setup(self):
    print('initialized from python.')

  def run(self, my):
    print('hello world.')
    return my

api.export(UntitledPythonPlugin())
</script>
```

## `Plugin API`
The plugin system of ImJoy is built upon remote procedure calls we implemented, an encoding and decoding scheme is used by ImJoy to transfer data and functions between plugins. It works by exposing a set of API functions both from the plugin or the main app. In the plugin, predefined object called `api` is to access the ImJoy API, detailed information can be found in the **ImJoy API** section. By using an ImJoy API called `api.export`, a set of functions can be exported as `Plugin APIs`, `setup` and `run` as described before are two mandatory `Plugin API` functions which need to be defined and exported. In addition to that, other functions can be also exported as `Plugin APIs`.

As you may see in the above examples, they both contain an `api.export` statement as the last line of the `<script>` code block.

```javascript
//Javascript
api.export(new UntitledJSPlugin())

# Python
api.export(UntitledPythonPlugin())
```

**Notice** that in Javascript, the `new` keyword is necessary to create an instance of a class, while in Python there is no `new` keyword.

## Callback functions
Besides the `Plugin API` functions, when a plugin is executed, you can return an object which includes functions which will be called by other plugins or ImJoy. However, if the function has never been exported as a `Plugin API` before, it will be treated a `callback` function and can be only called once. Otherwise, if the function has been exported as `Plugin API`, it won't be treated as `callback` function and can be called repeatly.

## `ImJoy API`
Within the plugin, there is a variable called `api` which exposes a set of internal utility functions. These utility functions can be used in the plugin to interact with the GUI, talk with another plugin etc.

When a `ImJoy API` function is executed, they will return a object called `promise` ([more about Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)).
For Javascrit plugins, native Javascrit `Promise` will be returned. For Python plugins, it will return a simplified Python implement of promise.

Here is how you can use it (suppose the api name is `XXXXX`):
```
// JavaScript
const callback(result){
  console.log(result)
}
api.XXXXX().then(callback)

// optionally, you can catch error
const error_callback(error){
  console.error(error)
}
api.XXXXX().then(callback).catch(error_callback)


# Python
def callback(result):
  print(result)

api.XXXXX().then(callback)

# optionally, you can catch error
def error_callback(error):
  print(error)

api.XXXXX().then(callback).catch(error_callback)
```

When calling the API functions, most functions take an object or dictionary as its first argument. For Javascript plugins, an object should be used. For Python plugins, you use a dictionary, or use named arguments. For example, the following function call will work in both JavaScript and Python:
```javascript
//# works for JavaScript and Python
api.XXXXX({"option1": 3, "option2": 'hi'})

# only for Python
api.XXXXX(option1=3, option2='hi')
```

### `api.alert(...)`
show alert dialog with message, example: `api.alert('hello world')`
### `api.register(...)`
register a new op, example code for JavaScript:
```javascript
    api.register({name: "LUT", ui: "apply LUT {id:'lut', type:'choose', options:['hot', 'rainbow'], placeholder: 'hot'}"})
```

Example code for Python:
```python
    api.register(name="LUT", ui="apply LUT {id:'lut', type:'choose', options:['hot', 'rainbow'], placeholder: 'hot'}")
```

Or, you can use the following version which works for both Javascript and Python:
```javascript
api.register({"name":"LUT", "ui":"apply LUT {id:'lut', type:'choose', options:['hot', 'rainbow'], placeholder: 'hot'}"})
```

By default, each all the ops created by the same plugin will call the same `run` function defined in the plugin, and you will need to use `my._op` in the `run` function to differentiate which op is called.

Alternatively, another `Plugin API` function other than `run` can be passed when calling `api.register`. For example, you can add  `"run": this.hello` in a Javascript plugin or `"run": self.hello` in a Python plugin if `hello` is a member function of the plugin class. When the registered op is exectued, `hello` will be called. **Note:** the function must be a member of the plugin class or being exported (with `api.export`) as a `Plugin API` function. This is because a arbitrary function transfered by ImJoy will be treated as `callback` function, thus only allowed to run once.

If you want to run a function whenever any option is changed, you can pass a `update` function. Similar to `run`, you need to pass a function from the member of the plugin class.

Here is an example which defines `run` and `update` in Python:

```python
class PythonPlugin():
  def apply_lut(self, my):
    ...
  def lut_updated(self, my):
    ...
  def setup(self):
    ...
    api.register(name="LUT",
                 ui="apply LUT {id:'lut', type:'choose', options:['hot', 'rainbow'], placeholder: 'hot'}",
                 run=self.apply_lut,
                 update=self.lut_updated)
    ...
```

### `api.createWindow(...)`
create a new window and add to the workspace, example:
```javascript
//Javascript
const window_callback = (windowId)=>{
  //use `windowId` here to access the window
  console.log(windowId)
}
api.createWindow({name: 'new window', type: 'Image Window', w:7, h:7, data: {image: ...}, config: {}}).then(window_callback)

# Python
def window_callback(windowId):
  # use `windowId` here to access the window
  print(windowId)
api.createWindow({name: 'new window', type: 'Image Window', w:7, h:7, data: {image: ...}, config: {}}).then(window_callback)
```

If you do not want the window to load immediately, you can add `click2load: true` and the window will ask for an extra click to load the content.

Once an window is created, it will return a window ID, which can be used for updating the window with `api.updateWindow`.

### `api.updateWindow(...)`
update an existing window, an window ID should be passed in order to perform the update, example:

```javascript

# Javascript
api.updateWindow({id: windowId, data: {image: ...}})

# Python
api.updateWindow({'id': windowId, 'data': {'image': ...}})
```

The second parameter is an object contains fields which the plugin wants to update.

### `api.showDialog(...)`
show a dialog with customized GUI, example:

```javascript
   api.showDialog({
      "name": "This is a dialog",
      "ui": "Hey, please select a value for sigma: {id:'sigma', type:'choose', options:['1', '3'], placeholder: '1'}.",
   }).then((result)=>{

   })
```
### `api.showProgress(...)`
update the progress bar on the Imjoy GUI, example: `api.showProgress(85)`
### `api.showStatus(...)`
update the status text on the Imjoy GUI, example: `api.showStatus('processing...')`
### `api.showSnackbar(...)`
show a quick message with a snackbar and disappear in a few seconds, example: `api.showSnackbar('processing...', 5)`
### `api.showPluginProgress(...)`
update the progress bar of the current plugin (in the plugin menu), example: `api.showPluginProgress(85)`
### `api.showPluginStatus(...)`
update the status text of the current plugin (in the plugin menu), example: `api.showPluginStatus('processing...')`

### `api.showFileDialog(...)`
show a file dialog for selecting files or directories. It accept the following options:
 * `type` the mode of file dialog, it accept `file` for selecting one or multiple files; `directory` for selecting one or multiple directories; By default, it will use `type='file'`. For Python plugin, if you don't specify the type, both file or directory can be selected.
 * `title` the title of the dialog.

Since the file handling is different in the browser environment and Python, this api have different behavior when called from different types of plugin. In Javascrpt and Python, an Imjoy file dialog will be displayed, it will only return a promise which you can get the file path string with.

Example:
```javascript
//javascript example
api.showFileDialog().then((file)=>{
  console.log(file)
})
```

```python
# python example
def print_path(path):
  print(path)
api.showFileDialog().then(print_path)
```

### `api.run(...)`
run another plugin by the plugin name, example: `api.run("Python Demo Plugin")` or `api.run("Python Demo Plugin", my)`

### `api.utils`
For Javascript plugins, currently supported functions are:
`api.utils.$forceUpdate` for force refreshing the GUI.

For Python Plugins, currently supported functions are:
`api.utils.kill` for kill a `subprocess` in python.

### `api.setConfig(...)`
Each plugin can store its configurations with `api.setConfig`. For example store a simple number `api.setConfig('sigma', 928)`,
you can also store an object `api.setConfig('sigma', {"a": 99, "b": "1234x3"})`.

**Note** this is designed for storing small amount of data, do not store large object.
Current implementation uses `localStorage` to store settings. Depends on different browsers, most of them can only allow 5M data storage shared by all the plugins and ImJoy app itself.

### `api.getConfig(...)`
This is used for retrieve configurations set by `api.setConfig(...)`.
For example in Javascrit you can use `const sigma = await api.getConfig('sigma')` to access get a previously stored settings.
Notice that `await` is needed because all the api are async functions. Alternatively, you can use `Promise` to access it: ` api.getConfig('sigma').then((sigma)=>{ console.log(sigma) })`.

Similarly, for Python, you will need to use callback function to access the result:
```python
def print_sigma(result):
    print(result)

api.getConfig('sigma').then(print_sigma)
```

### `api.getAttachment(...)`
You can store any text data such as base64 encoded images, code and json in `<attachment>` tag, for example if you have the following tag in the plugin file:
```
<attachment name="att_name">

</attachment>
```

To get the content in JavaScript or Python, you can use `api.getAttachment("att_name")`.
```
// JavaScript
api.getAttachment("att_name").then((content)=>{
  console.log(content)
})

# Python
def callback(content):
    print(content)

api.getAttachment("att_name").then(callback)
```


## Developing Window Plugin
Window plugin is a speical type of plugins running in `iframe` mode, and it will show up as a window. `<window>` and `<style>` can be used to define the actual content of the window.

I order to make a `window` plugin, you need to add `window` to `tags` and set `mode` as `iframe` in the `<config>` tag.

Different from other plugins which will be loaded and intialized when ImJoy is started, a `window` plugin will not be loaded until the actuall plugin is created with `api.createWindow` or clicked by a user in the menu. During execution of `api.createWindow`, `setup` and `run` will be called for the first time, and return with an window ID. After that, if needed, another plugin can call `api.updateWindow` with the window ID, ImJoy will try to execute the `run` function with the new data again.

If the `run` returned with an object, then it will be used to update the window status managed by ImJoy. This means, for example, if the user changed the name of the plugin, it can be achieved by returning the same `my` object in the `run` function.


## Developing Webworker Plugin

## Developing Python Plugins

For plugin developers, you can now create a python plugin within the browser.

Here is a python `hello world` example:
```html
<config lang="json">
{
  "name": "Python Hello World Plugin",
  "mode": "pyworker",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "api_version": "0.1.1",
  "description": "A python plugin demo.",
  "tags": ["demo", "op"],
  "ui": "print hello world from python",
  "inputs": null,
  "outputs": null,
  "icon": null,
  "env": null,
  "requirements": ["numpy"],
  "cmd": "python",
  "dependencies": []
}
</config>

<script lang="python">
import numpy as np

class PythonPlugin():
  def setup(self):
    pass

  def run(self, my):
    print('hello world.')
    return my

api.export(PythonPlugin())
</script>

```

### Using virtual environments
  Python plugins for ImJoy can have different conda environments, which provides a way to isolate plugins. You can therefore run python plugins with different versions of Python, or use different pip packages.



  By default, python plugins from ImJoy will be executed in the default conda environment(Python 3.6). If you want to run a plugin in a different conda environment, you can specify it by setting the `env` field in the `<config>` section of the plugin.

  It is also important to specify the pip packages required by the plugin, this can be done with the `requirements` field in `<config>`.

  Examples:
   * If you want to run your plugin with Python 2.7, you just need to add the following fields to your `<config>`:
  ```json
  <config>
    ...
    "env": "conda create -y -n python2 python=2.7",
    "requirements": ["numpy", "scipy"],
    "cmd": "python",
    ...
  </config>
  ```

   * Similarly, if you want to run your plugin with Python 3.6, you just need to add the following fields to your `<config>`:
  ```json
  <config>
    ...
    "env": "conda create -y -n python3 python=3.6",
    "requirements": ["numpy", "scipy"],
    "cmd": "python",
    ...
  </config>
  ```
  **Note 1**: in `requirements`, you can also specify the version number, for example `numpy>=1.15.0`. If you want to install conda modules or you want to run pip with other parameters, you can set `requirements` as a command string instead of a list, for example: you can do `requirements: "conda install opencv-python && pip install numpy"`.

  **Note 2**: in the `env` field, you need to use `-n XXXX` to name your environment, otherwise, it will use the plugin name to name the environment.

### TODO: Use Docker Containers
 **Not yet supported**

 Python plugin can also be ran with Docker.
 Examples:
  * If you want to run your plugin with tensorflow docker, you need to add the following fields to your `<config>`:
 ```json
 <config>
   ...
   "env": "docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:1.9.0-py3",
   "requirements": ["numpy", "scipy"],
   "cmd": "python",
   ...
 </config>
 ```

# Testing and deploying your own plugin
During the development of a plugin, you can use chrome dev tool to debug your javascript plugin. Python plugins can be tested alone first and then wrap as python modules, you can import them by running the `python -m imjoy` in the directory with your modules.

For depolying your plugin, if they do not depend on library or module written by your self, you could just upload the file to a Github repository. For sharing with others, you can copy the link point to the `raw` file. Other uses can use the url to install from ImJoy. If you want to contribute your plugin to the ImJoy central repository, so users can directly install from the plugin store shown on ImJoy.io, you need to send a pull request to the repository. More details about that: [ImJoy-Plugins repository].

If your plugin depends on non-standard libraries and modules, and you want to provid them with your plugin. You just need to upload those libraries and modules to a github [gist](https://gist.github.com/) or repository, and link them in the plugin code.

 * for javascript plugin with extra dependencies, you need to create a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) or repository on Github named with the plugin name, and upload the plugin file together with other javascript files. In the plugin file, you can use `importScripts(url_to_your_js_file)` function to use this libraries. However, due to a restriction of Github, you can't use the url of github directly, you need to copy the url of your javascript file, and convert it with [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/).
 * for python plugin with extra dependencies, you need to create a `setup.py` file to wrap the plugin as a pip module, create a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) or repository on Github named with the plugin name, and upload the plugin file together with your python modules. Now add the github link to `requirements` in `<config>` of your plugin. The github link should be formated to something like: `git+https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Python#egg=imjoy`, you can test with the `pip install ...` command to see if you can install your module.

The plugin store shown on the ImJoy.IO is served with Github through the [ImJoy-Plugins repository](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Plugins).

In order to deploy your plugin to the plugin store, you can fork the repository, add your plugin and then send a pull request to [ImJoy-Plugins](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Plugins). Once the pull request being accepted, the user will be able to install your plugin from the plugin store.
